# SKCDA - People-Centred Design by Euphorbias
ENSE 271 Group Project

## Introduction
Our ENSE 271 group project involves improving the Saskatchewan Career Development Association (SKCDA) website. The website should be attractive, user-friendly, and include the necessary features. Throughout this project, we will learn how to apply design principles to our design process and prioritize user needs. We will also conduct tests and use the results to improve the design.
