### Empathy Mappings
Empathy Mappings are visuals that provide insights into users' attitudes and behaviours, making them a valuable tool for our team to understand the users better.

### Problem description

The SKCDA seeks a visually appealing and user-friendly website design focusing on membership. As a voluntary sector organization, their lack of knowledge about web design has hindered their progress. They have identified several features that require improvement.

1. User-friendly navigation that facilitates easy access to member resources, a member-only networking section, and a resource-sharing section for CDPs.
2. SKDCA aims to increase membership and provide a signup and payment tool.
3. Additionally, they require a way for people to request information and join their mailing list and up-to-date information on national certification for CDPs.
4. Their current website is hosted on Weebly, but they are open to migrating to WordPress. However, they should be able to maintain the webpage.
