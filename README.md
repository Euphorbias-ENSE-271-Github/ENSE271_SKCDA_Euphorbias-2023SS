### Empathy Mappings
Empathy Mappings are visuals that provide insights into users' attitudes and behaviours, making them a valuable tool for our team to understand the users better.

### Affinity Diagramming Documents
An effective grouping method that draws meaningful conclusions from subjective and scattered information obtained from users.

### Insight Document
Insight charts help us comprehend the requirements of users and the reasons behind those requirements.

### User Story Map
