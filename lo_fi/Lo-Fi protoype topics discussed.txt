Assignment 2 Notes on topic explored in lo-fi prototype:

Some of the Topics explored and used in the lo-fi prototype were using North American cultural and logical design with the most
important information being on the top and left to gather the attention of the reader.

As well attention to what the SKCDA wanted in their design (being a focus on Membership) led to the perceived Utility and Usability 
of including a link to Join in the footer and in various other places so no matter which page a potential member/someone browsing 
the website was on when browsing the website they would never stray far from the ability to join the SKCDA as a member. 

Another aspect of human centered design was to use icons in the lo-fi design that actually correlated to what the icons would do 
(i.e. email icons to signify emails). 

Physical constraints were also taken into account with design elements not 
having any additional training elements needed to understand what they do.

As well, an element of gestalt, similarity was taken into account with the header and footer having much of the same elements 
to allow for a sense of familiarity to be acquired and to not confuse the user.
